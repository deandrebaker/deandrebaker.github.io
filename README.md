Hi, my name is Deandre Baker, and this is my website! Here, you can find summaries about various projects I've created, as well as links to my GitHub repositories where you can find the source code for these projects.

# About Me
I am a junior software developer with a passion for electronics and computer programs. I am currently studying at the University of Waterloo, which is a school renowned for its state of the art engineering program and fantastic co-operative education. I have 4+ years of experience in computer programming and designing electronic circuits. I am proficient in the languages Java, C#, C, C++, and Python, and I continue to learn more languages and technologies. I am also a passionate martial artist with a second-degree black belt in 2 different styles!

# Work Experience
Most recently, I have work with HRWARE, a human resource management software company, where I built a Cortana skill to assist in human resource management. Through this work experience, I learned how to use technologies such as Microsoft's .NET and Bot frameworks to create an online chatbot able to sign in an employee, book vacations days, and allow a manager to approve or cancel vacation requests. All these features are performed through the hands-free Cortana virtual assistant, which reduces the need to log on to websites or wait for additional applications to open. I have also worked as a martial arts instructor, where I taught youth classes basic martial arts techniques and principles such as discipline and respect.

# Projects
These are some of the notable projects I've worked on. The source code for all of these projects can be found on my GitHub page. Many of these projects include technologies such as the Arduino microcontroller, sensors, motors, LEDs, and various modules.

## Artificial Gravity Room

The Artificial Gravity Room was a miniature model of a room able to increase the apparent gravity felt by a user standing inside it. Unlike preexisting artificial gravity rooms that can increase the g-forces experienced by a seated user, this device allows the user to stand and move freely within the room. This way, researchers can test the effect of higher levels of gravity on a person's skeletal system when performing tasks such as running, jumping, and relaxing. Other applications for this device would be strength and conditioning training for athletes.

## Concussion Detection Helmet

The Concussion Detection Helmet was a diagnostic device used to detect concussions during an accident. The user wears it while they are participating in a sport or activity where the possibility of brain injury is present. The device can detect concussions by continuously monitoring the acceleration of the helmet. If the acceleration is over a specific threshold, then it would indicate that brain injury may have occurred. When a concussion is detected, an LED changes from green to yellow and a buzzer starts beeping. In the event of a severe concussion, the light changes straight to red and the buzzer plays a low tone. The user and the referee of the sport would be aware of the potential brain damage and the level of danger the user is in, preventing a minor or severe concussion from going unnoticed.

## Electrician Calculator

The Electrician Calculator is a Java application used to assist electricians with calculating electrical quantities. This includes quantities such as voltage, current, resistance, and capacitance in both series and parallel circuits. The app allowed the user to save calculated values and use them in other calculations. This app could benefit beginner circuit designers who are learning to design electronic circuits using electronic components such as batteries, resistors, and integrated circuits.

## Crash Caller

The Crash Caller is an integrable car framework that calls 911 in the event of a car crash. The device is placed into a car and continuously measures the acceleration and orientation of the vehicle. If the vehicle experiences a sudden change in velocity from a collision, the device will call EMS and relay the longitude and latitude of the location where the accident occurred and the time when it happened. The device will also send a text message with that information as well. The user can abort the call by pressing the abort button within 10 seconds of the crash in the scenario that the collision was not severe. This device would help save the lives of unconscious victims of car collisions in locations where there are no witnesses to call EMS.

## Bright Brain

Bright Brain is a mental illness diagnostic device created to raise mental health awareness. The device conducts an interactive survey for the user to complete and diagnoses them as healthy, depressed, bipolar, or having anxiety. The device also diagnoses the severity of each mental illness as either mild, moderate, or severe. The user inputs their answers using a 7 inch LCD touch screen that would also display questions, options, and the results. Upon completing the survey, the device shows the results on the screen. It also illuminates a transparent model of a brain based on the results, showing where the most active parts of the brain are for someone with that diagnosis. When idle, the device displays mental illness statistics and facts.

## Automated Soil pH Adjuster
![20190530_133748](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49622234/62903977-8b9f5400-bd32-11e9-8bec-8b1f7405d618.jpg)

The Automated Soil pH Adjuster is a prototype device that adjusts the pH of the soil to the optimal level for a particular plant. The user would set the pH that they would like the soil to be, and the device would add either an acid or a base to adjust the acidity or basicity of the water. When the soil becomes dry, the device will pump the pH adjusted water into the pot of soil for the plant to use. The device would also log the pH, humidity, temperature, and soil moisture onto an SD card as well as display it to a computer screen.
